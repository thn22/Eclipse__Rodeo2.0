**Proposal:**

  Throughout the pandemic, many people filled their freetime with streaming content from Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu. After two plus years, people want to know -- What to watch next? Using data sources from Kaggle, we want to know which streaming service produces the best original content, which actor(s) to seek out, which long running shows are the best, and what genre is the most popular.

**Initial questions:** 
1. Which director with 4 or more movies has the highest average rating?
2. Is there a correlation between number of seasons for a TV show and IMDb score?
3. Is there a correlation between movie run times and IMDb score?
4. Which streaming service is most catered towards adults? Which is best for children?
5. Do older movies have higher IMDb scores than newer movies?
