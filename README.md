**Proposal:**

  Throughout the pandemic, many people filled their freetime with streaming content from Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu. After two plus years, people want to know -- What to watch next? Using data sources from Kaggle, we want to know which streaming service produces the best original content, which actor(s) to seek out, which long running shows are the best, and what genre is the most popular.

**Initial questions:**
1. Which streaming service has the best original content? (Using ratings from OMDb)
2. Which actor has the highest average rating?
3. Is there a correlation between number of seasons for a TV show and OMDb score?
4. Is there a correlation between movie run times and OMDb score?
5. What genre has the highest rating across all streaming services? (Movies)
